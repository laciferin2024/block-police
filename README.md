# Financial Investment Advisor Agent - Fetch.ai Example

A demonstration of how to integrate **SingularityNET's MeTTa Knowledge Graph** with **Fetch.ai's uAgents** to create intelligent, autonomous agents that can understand and respond to investment queries using structured financial knowledge reasoning.

## ü§ñ What is MeTTa by SingularityNET?

**MeTTa** (Meta Type Talk) is a multi-paradigm language for declarative and functional computations over knowledge (meta)graphs developed by SingularityNET. It provides a powerful framework for:

- **Structured Knowledge Representation**: Organize information in logical, queryable formats
- **Symbolic Reasoning**: Perform complex logical operations and pattern matching
- **Knowledge Graph Operations**: Build, query, and manipulate knowledge graphs

MeTTa uses a space-based architecture where knowledge is stored as atoms in logical spaces, enabling sophisticated querying and reasoning capabilities.

## üîó What is Fetch.ai?

**Fetch.ai** provides a complete ecosystem for building, deploying and discovering AI Agents. Key features include:

- **uAgents Framework**: Python-based framework for building autonomous agents
- **Agentverse**: Open marketplace for agent discovery and interaction
- **Chat Protocol**: Standardized communication protocol to make agents discoverable through ASI:One
- **ASI:One**: An agentic LLM that can interact with different agents on Agentverse to answer user queries.

## üß† MeTTa Components Explained

### Core MeTTa Elements

#### 1. **Space (Knowledge Container)**
```python
metta = MeTTa()  # Creates a new MeTTa instance with a space
```
The space is where all knowledge atoms are stored and queried.

#### 2. **Atoms (Knowledge Units)**
Atoms are the fundamental units of knowledge in MeTTa:

- **E (Expression)**: Creates logical expressions
- **S (Symbol)**: Represents symbolic atoms
- **ValueAtom**: Stores actual values (strings, numbers, etc.)

#### 3. **Knowledge Graph Structure**
```python
# Risk Profile ‚Üí Investment Types
metta.space().add_atom(E(S("risk_profile"), S("conservative"), S("bonds")))

# Investment Types ‚Üí Expected Returns  
metta.space().add_atom(E(S("expected_return"), S("bonds"), ValueAtom("3-5% annually")))

# Investment Types ‚Üí Risk Levels
metta.space().add_atom(E(S("risk_level"), S("bonds"), ValueAtom("low risk, stable income")))
```

#### 4. **Querying with Pattern Matching**
```python
# Find investment types for risk profile
query_str = '!(match &self (risk_profile conservative $investment) $investment)'
results = metta.run(query_str)
```

### Key MeTTa Concepts

- **`&self`**: References the current space
- **`$variable`**: Pattern matching variables
- **`!(match ...)`**: Query syntax for pattern matching
- **`E(S(...), S(...), ...)`**: Creates logical expressions

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

### Core Components

1. **`agent.py`**: Main uAgent implementation with Chat Protocol to make the agent queryable through ASI:One.
2. **`knowledge.py`**: MeTTa knowledge graph initialization
3. **`investment_rag.py`**: Investment RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system
4. **`utils.py`**: LLM integration and query processing logic

### Data Flow

User Query ‚Üí Intent Classification ‚Üí MeTTa Query ‚Üí Knowledge Retrieval ‚Üí LLM Response ‚Üí User

## üîß Integration with uAgents

### Using This as a Template

This project serves as a template for integrating MeTTa with uAgents. The key integration point is the `process_query` function in `utils.py`, which you can customize for your specific use case.

### Customization Steps

1. **Modify Knowledge Graph** (`knowledge.py`):
   ```python
   def initialize_investment_knowledge(metta: MeTTa):
       # Add your domain-specific knowledge
       metta.space().add_atom(E(S("your_relation"), S("subject"), S("object")))
   ```

2. **Update Query Processing** (`utils.py`):
   ```python
   def process_query(query, rag: InvestmentRAG, llm: LLM):
       # Implement your domain-specific logic
       intent, keyword = get_intent_and_keyword(query, llm)
       # Add your custom processing logic here
   ```

3. **Extend RAG System** (`investment_rag.py`):
   ```python
   class InvestmentRAG:
       def __init__(self, metta_instance: MeTTa):
           self.metta = metta_instance
       
       def query_your_domain(self, query):
           # Implement your domain-specific queries
           query_str = f'!(match &self (your_relation {query} $result) $result)'
           return self.metta.run(query_str)
   ```

## üí° Key Features

### 1. **Dynamic Knowledge Learning**
The agent can learn new information and add it to the MeTTa knowledge graph:
```python
# Automatically adds new knowledge when not found
rag.add_knowledge("risk_profile", "ultra_conservative", "treasury_bills")
```

### 2. **Intent Classification**
Uses ASI:One to classify user intent and extract keywords:
- `risk_profile`: Find investments suitable for risk tolerance
- `investment_advice`: Get investment recommendations
- `returns`: Learn about expected returns
- `allocation`: Age-based asset allocation strategies
- `goal`: Investment strategies for specific goals
- `sector`: Information about market sectors
- `faq`: Answer general investment questions

### 3. **Structured Reasoning**
MeTTa enables complex logical reasoning:
```python
# Find investments for risk profile and get their returns
investments = rag.query_risk_profile("conservative")
returns = rag.get_expected_return(investments[0])
risks = rag.get_risk_level(investments[0])
```

### 4. **Agentverse Integration**
The agent automatically:
- Registers on Agentverse for discovery
- Implements Chat Protocol for ASI:One accessibility
- Provides a web interface for testing
